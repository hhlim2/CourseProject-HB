Agglomerative and Divisive Clustering 157distance\\n1234561\\n2\\n34561 cluster\\n2 clusters\\n6 clusters\\nFigure 8.1: Left, a dataset; right, a dendrogram obtained by agglomerative cluster-\\ning using single-link clustering. If one selects a particular value of distance, thena horizontal line at that distance splits the dendrogram into clusters. This repre-\\nsentation makes it possible to guess how many clusters there are and to get some\\ninsight into how good the clusters are\\n8.1.1 Clustering and Distance\\nIn the algorithms above, and in what follows, we assume that the features are scaled\\nso that distances (measured in the usual way) between data points are a good\\nrepresentation of their similarity. This is quite an important point. For example,\\nimagine we are clustering data representing brick walls. The features might containseveral distances: the spacing between the bricks, the length of the wall, the height\\nof the wall, and so on. If these distances are given in the same set of units, we could\\nhave real trouble. For example, assume that the units are centimeters. Then thespacing between bricks is of the order of one or two centimeters, but the heights\\nof the walls will be in the hundreds of centimeters. In turn, this means that the\\ndistance between two data points is likely to be completely dominated by the height\\nand length data. This could bewhat we want, but it might also not beagood thing.\\nThere are some ways to manage this issue. One is to know what the features', '8.1. Agglomerative and Divisive Clustering 156\\nProcedure: 8.1 Agglomerative Clustering\\nChoose an inter-cluster distance.

Regard the entire dataset as a single clus-\\nter. Now, until the clustering is satisfactory,\\n•choose a cluster to split;\\n•then split this cluster into two parts.\\nTo turn these recipes into algorithms requires some more detail. For agglom-\\nerative clustering, we need to choose a good inter-cluster distance to fuse nearby\\nclusters. Even if a natural distance between data points is available, there is no\\ncanonical inter-cluster distance. Generally, one chooses a distance that seems ap-propriate for the dataset. For example, one might choose the distance between the\\nclosest elements as the inter-cluster distance, which tends to yield extended clusters\\n(statisticians call this method single-link clustering ). Another natural choice is\\nthemaximum distancebetweenanelementoftheﬁrstclusterandoneofthesecond,\\nwhich tends to yield rounded clusters (statisticians call this method complete-link\\nclustering ). Finally, one could use an average of distances between elements in the\\ncluster, which also tends to yield rounded clusters (statisticians call this method\\ngroup average clustering ).\\nFordivisiveclustering,weneedasplittingmethod.

We won’t pursue this question further.\\nFinally, we need to know when to stop. This is an intrinsically diﬃcult task\\nif there is no model for the process that generated the clusters. The recipes I have\\ndescribed generate a hierarchy of clusters. Usually, this hierarchy is displayed toau s e ri nt h ef o r mo fa dendrogram —a representation of the structure of the hi-\\nerarchy of clusters that displays inter-cluster distances—and an appropriate choice\\nof clusters is made from the dendrogram (see the example in Fig. 8.1).\\nAnother important thing to notice about clustering from the example of\\nFig.8.1is that there is no right answer. There are a variety of diﬀerent clusterings\\nof the same data. For example, depending on what scales in that ﬁgure mean, itmight be right to zoom out and regard all of the data as a single cluster, or to zoom\\nin and regard each data point as a cluster.

In\\nagglomerative clustering , you start with each data item being a cluster, and\\nthen merge clusters recursively to yield a good clustering (Procedure 8.1). The\\ndiﬃculty here is that we need to know a good way to measure the distance between\\nclusters, which can be somewhat harder than the distance between points. In\\ndivisive clustering , you start with the entire dataset being a cluster, and then\\nsplit clusters recursively to yield a good clustering (Procedure 8.2). The diﬃculty\\nhere is we need to know some criterion for splitting clusters.\\n©Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019\\nD.

Regard the entire dataset as a single clus-<unk> nter. Now, until the clustering is satisfactory,<unk> n•choose a cluster to split;<unk> nthen split this cluster into two parts.<unk> nTo turn these recipes into algorithms requires some more detail. For agglomerative clustering, we need to choose a good inter-cluster distance to fuse nearby clusters. Even if a natural distance between data points is available, there is no canonical inter-cluster distance. Generally, one chooses a distance that seems ap-propriate for the dataset. For example, one might choose the distance between the<unk>nclosest elements as the inter-c'"
